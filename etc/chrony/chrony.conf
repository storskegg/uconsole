# SHM refclock is shared memory driver, it is populated by GPSd and read by chrony
# it is SHM 0
# refid is what we want to call this source = NMEA
# offset = 0.000 means we do not yet know the delay
# precision is how precise this is. not 1e-3 = 1 millisecond, so not very precision
# poll 0 means poll every 2^0 seconds = 1 second poll interval
# filter 3 means take the average/median (forget which) of the 3 most recent readings. NMEA can be jumpy so we're averaging here
refclock SHM 0 refid NMEA offset 0.000 precision 1e-3 poll 0 filter 3

# PPS refclock is PPS specific, with /dev/pps0 being the source
# refid PPS means call it the PPS source
# lock NMEA means this PPS source will also lock to the NMEA source for time of day info
# offset = 0.0 means no offset... this should probably always remain 0
# poll 3 = poll every 2^3=8 seconds. polling more frequently isn't necessarily better
# trust means we trust this time. the NMEA will be kicked out as false ticker eventually, so we need to trust the combo
